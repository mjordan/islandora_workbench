## Adding media to nodes

You can add media to nodes by providing a CSV file with a `node_id` column plus a `file` field that contains the name of the file you want to add. For example, your CSV file could look like this:

```csv
node_id,file
100,test.txt
```

The config file for update operations looks like this (note the `task` option is 'add_media'):

```yaml
task: add_media
host: "http://localhost:8000"
username: admin
password: islandora
input_csv: add_media.csv
```
